We'll treat a playlist as if it's a sentence and the songs it contains as words. We feed that to the word2vec algorithm which then learns embeddings for every song we have. These embeddings can then be used to recommend similar songs. This technique is used by Spotify, AirBnB, Alibaba, and others. It accounts for a vast portion of their user activity, user media consumption, and/or sales (in the case of Alibaba).\n","\n","The [dataset we'll use](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shuochen/lme/data_page.html) was collected by Shuo Chen from Cornell University.
